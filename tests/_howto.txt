 split the great big test file into parts using 
  csplit -f ct constcl16.test /^return$/+1 {*}
 then, I gave the files the correct extension
 with

for file in *
do
  mv "$file" "${file%.}.test"
done

 I found that I had to do more splitting-up.
 This time I tried automatic splitting rather
 than scrolling the content up and down.
 I gathered the five lines like this:
 1: cleanupTests
 2: return
 3:
 4: package require tcltest
 5: namespace import -force tcltest::*
 6: source constcl.tcl

 and used the ed command 
  g/\<test \w\+-\d\+\.0/ v/initial-1.0/ 1,7t.-1
 to find each beginning test in each series
 and copy the lines 1-7 to the line above
 that. The v// command was for avoiding an extra
 line group after the 1-7 lines. I used
  csplit -f ct constcl16.test /^return$/+1 {*}
 to split the test file into pieces and

for file in *
do
  mv "$file" "${file%.}.test"
done

to give them the proper extension. Unfortunately
I forgot that the previous batch of file were
getting an extension of .test.test by this. 

for file in *.test.test
do
  mv "$file" "${file%.test.test}.test"
done

sorted that out.
