H2 Environment class and objects

MD(
The class for environments is called K{Environment}. It is mostly a wrapper around a dictionary,
with the added finesse of keeping a link to the outer environment (starting a chain that goes all
the way to the global environment and then stops at the null environment) which can be traversed
by the find method to find which innermost environment a given symbol is bound in.

The long and complex constructor is to accommodate the variations of Scheme parameter lists, which 
can be empty, a proper list, a symbol, or a dotted list.

H3 Lexical scoping

MD(
Example:
MD)

VB(
ConsTcl> (define (circle-area r) (* pi (* r r)))
ConsTcl> (circle-area 10)
314.1592653589793
VB)

MD(
During a call to the procedure K{circle-area}, the symbol K{r} is bound to the
value 10. But we don't want the binding to go into the global environment,
possibly clobbering an earlier definition of K{r}. The solution is to use
separate (but linked) environments, making K{r}'s binding a
W{local variable}{Local_variable}I{local variable}
in its own environment, which the procedure will be evaluated in. The symbols
K{*} and K{pi} will still be available through the local environment's link
to the outer global environment. This is all part of
W{lexical scoping}{Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scope}I{lexical scope}.

In the first image, we see the global environment before we call K{circle-area}
(and also the empty null environment which the global environment links to):

During the call. Note how the global K{r} is shadowed by the local one, and how
the local environment links to the global one to find K{*} and K{pi}.

After the call, we are back to the first state again.
